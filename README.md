## Introduction

The Solana blockchain is known for its speed and low transaction costs. The Solana Stream SDK allows developers to leverage these advantages by providing tools to efficiently manage data streams from the blockchain. This SDK supports various protocols and languages, including Rust and TypeScript, making it versatile for different development environments.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Streaming**: Receive live updates from the Solana blockchain.
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Utilize gRPC, HTTP/2, and QUIC for communication.
- **Shred Management**: Efficiently handle shreds and shred streams.
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality with custom geyser plugins.
- **Cross-Language Compatibility**: Work with both Rust and TypeScript.
- **Web3 Integration**: Seamlessly connect with web3 applications.

## Installation

To get started with the Solana Stream SDK, you can clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies. Hereâ€™s how:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinodchandu7/solana-stream.git
cd solana-stream
# Install dependencies (adjust based on your package manager)
npm install
```

For Rust users, make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. You can use `cargo` to manage your dependencies.

```bash
cargo build
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the Solana Stream SDK in your project.

#### TypeScript

```typescript
import { Stream } from 'solana-stream-sdk';

const stream = new Stream();

stream.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log('New data received:', data);
});

stream.start();
```

#### Rust

```rust
use solana_stream_sdk::Stream;

fn main() {
    let mut stream = Stream::new();
    
    stream.on_data(|data| {
        println!("New data received: {:?}", data);
    });

    stream.start();
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

You can customize your stream settings to optimize performance based on your application's needs. Hereâ€™s how:

#### TypeScript Configuration

```typescript
const stream = new Stream({
    protocol: 'grpc',
    options: {
        maxRetries: 5,
        timeout: 3000,
    },
});
```

#### Rust Configuration

```rust
let mut stream = Stream::new_with_options(StreamOptions {
    protocol: Protocol::Http2,
    max_retries: 5,
    timeout: Duration::from_secs(3),
});
```
